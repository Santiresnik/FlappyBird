/**
This file contains the main game loop and handles the high-level game state transitions
such as switching between the menu, playing, game over, and quit states.
It initializes the game, seeds the random number generator, calculates frame delta time,
processes input, and updates the game logic accordingly.

Key components used:
- GameState: Holds the current game data and status.
- InputAction: Represents user input actions.
- Timer: Used to calculate frame timing for smooth updates.
